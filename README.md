# Breakout Quest
## A Julian McNeill Game

Look at all of these blocks! Where are they coming from? Who's making them?
All you know is: they're getting in your way! So, what's a paddle like yourself
to do? SMASH SMASH SMASH!!! Use your signature ability to shoot balls of pure
kinetic energy to destroy all the blocks that stand in your way. Watch out
for special blocks and Boss Blocks, and who knows, you may get yourself into the
Hall of Fame or something...

### How to Play
Use the mouse to move the Paddle


### About this Game
This game is Section 5 of the [Unity 2D Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/content)
course by GameDev.tv on Udemy. The features I'm planning to add are:

+ Paddle Bump: create new trajectories by giving your paddle a quick bump upwards
+ Power-ups: give your ball and paddle some special properties to break blocks more efficiently and score more points
+ Score multiplier: destroying more blocks before the ball hits the paddle will earn you more points
+ Boss levels: these blocks are tougher than the rest
+ Difficulty levels: speed up the game, upping its difficulty


### To-Do List
+ Core gameplay
+ Paddle bump
+ Power-ups
+ Different block types
+ Scoring system
+ Boss Blocks
+ Hard Mode
+ Level select menu

### Potential New Features
+ Paddle physics: give rebounding ball different trajectories based on where it hits the paddle
